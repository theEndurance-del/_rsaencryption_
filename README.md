# faulty_rsaencryption_code

This is a test program to use rsa encryption algorithm which I have written just for learning purpose.This program does not actually does anything correctly.
I have written two variants one in ````python```` and other in ````JAVA````. Since These programs are incomplete and not working properly anyone a help from anyone is accepted to make these programs work(All of this is just for learning sake so please excuse my improper knowledge and please help me learn).
