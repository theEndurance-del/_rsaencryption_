# _rsaencryption_

This contains two programs one in `python` and other in `JAVA`.
Both the programs tend to achieve the same goal "To encrypt any string using RSA Algorithm".

The `python` program has advanced to String Manipulation.

The `JAVA` program has yet to be modified to encrypt the string, But it can generate the key values faster than the `python` program.

Any kind of help would be appreciated to modify these programs.
